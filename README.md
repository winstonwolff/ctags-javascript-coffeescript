# Exhuberant CTAGS configuration for Javascript and Coffeescript

There are a bunch of sample regex's around for Javascript and Coffeescript. I found
they mostly worked but would fail for some situations. I would find a different configuration
which fixed my current need but broke something else on another project.

So I wrote some automated tests to check all the different scenarios as any
agile programmer would.

This configuration started from here:
